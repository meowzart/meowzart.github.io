<h1>Privacy  Policy</h1>
<p>Meowzart (hereafter may also be referred to as “We”, “Us”, “Our”, “Me”, “I”) cares about your privacy and is in the business of distributing useful apps and not your data.
Your Consent
By using our apps, you consent to our Privacy Policy
1. Your Data
Meowzart automatically generates an Account ID for you when you launch the iOS app and complete the on-boarding process. This is to ensure no personally identifiable information is collected or logged. 
All communications between Meowzart and its servers always happens over HTTPs.
2. Analytics
Meowzart does not use any 3rd party Analytics service. If you have the “Share with App Developers” option enabled on your iOS device, Apple will share this data with us in a completely anonymous manner. This is governed by Apple’s Privacy Policy.
Meowzart’s web service captures the following information anonymously: 
* When an article is opened, the article’s identifier is logged. The article’s identifier is unique to Meowzart. 
* When a feed is subscribed to, the feed’s identifier is logged. The feed’s identifier is unique to Meowzart. 
This information is used for suggesting trending and most subscribed feeds to new customers of the app. All information collected on the server cannot identify any particular customer. 
The web service only stores aggregated analytics data on a per hour basis.
The web service does not log or collect IP addresses from connecting devices.
3. Testflight
Some users will have access to Meowzart’s beta builds through Testflight. This requires us to provide Apple with the user’s name and email ID which is collected through a form subject to user consent. This process is subject to Testflight’s Privacy Policy.
4. Apple
Meowzart for iOS is distributed through the App Store and therefore the use of Meowzart is also subject to Apple’s Privacy Policy. 
5. Sharing Data
When Law Enforcement Agencies legally request for customer data, we are liable to provide such information which may include:
* all email correspondences
* all interactions over social media including private communications 
All correspondences over social media are subject to the Privacy Policy of that service and are beyond the scope of this policy. 
This is subject to a single constraint that you have previously mentioned your Account ID to us or we can identify you through some unique ID (example, Email ID). 
Since Meowzart does not collect any personally identifying information from you, our scope of identifying a customer and therefore being able to share such information is very limited.
6. Changes to this policy
All changes to the document will be listed below under the History subtitle. The current revision date is mentioned at the top. We reserve the right to update our privacy policy without notifying our users and customers before or after the update.</p>
