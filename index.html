The male brain is programmed to believe that a woman with a big butt and curved spine is the ideal mate.

User Reviews
"Never knew I would get this much done in 5 minutes. I can feel my butt burning. I recommend this app to anybody who wants to get your booty working" - Liz, California

"This workout is very effective. At first I thought it wasn't going to be an app that I would keep using with because it was too easy. I was wrong. As you progress through the app recommends you to use more weights(I have ankle weights), and it is very challenging! 5 minutes is all you need and u will be thankful when it's over!  " - Alice, from San Diego

"This app is a great workout that can be done in just a few minutes. My butt wouldn't have grown this much without this app." - Jenny, from NYC
