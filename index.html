<h2>Bootyfy - Leg Workout Program</h2>
<p>Given pictures of 3 women with varying butt sizes, 95% of men found the one with big butts most appealing. The main reason men is wired to find big butts more attractive is that they are subconsciously associated with extensive procreation and increased activity during pregnancy. The male brain is programmed to believe that a woman with a big butt and curved spine is the ideal mate.

Divided into 5 sets, Bootyfy will guide you through a 7 minute timed exercise sequence. As you progress through more rounds of booty workout, you will be rewarded with Bootycoins, which you can use to build the beach.

User Reviews
"Never knew I would get this much done in 5 minutes. I can feel my butt burning. I recommend this app to anybody who wants to get your booty working" - Liz, California

"This workout is very effective. At first I thought it wasn't going to be an app that I would keep using with because it was too easy. I was wrong. As you progress through the app recommends you to use more weights(I have ankle weights), and it is very challenging! 5 minutes is all you need and u will be thankful when it's over!  " - Alice, from San Diego
